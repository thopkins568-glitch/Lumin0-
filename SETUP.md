# Lumin0 — Setup & Installation Guide
This guide explains how to install and run the **Lumin0 tension-field optimization benchmark**.

Lumin0 tests whether adding a *physics-inspired tension force* between search points can reduce **FLOPs** while still finding good solutions on classic optimization functions (Rastrigin, Rosenbrock, etc.).
